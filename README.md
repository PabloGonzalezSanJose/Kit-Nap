# 2D ZENITHAL-VIEW ROGUELITE VIDEOGAME 

The game is a lineal roguelite where the player has to follow the trail of his dog kidnaping in order to save it. In order to do that, he will have to traverse 4 diferent areas, making his way through all diferent sorts of enemies and face a final boss, all without dying or all of his progress will be lost and he will have to start all over again from scratch. 

During his adventure, the player will be able to collect objetct that will help him progress, such as weapons (melee or distance), coins, life points, game modifiers... 

## Story and Theme: 

The protagonist wakes up and realizes his dog is missing and the door is open, so he goes out to search for it through a field/forest. After a while, he finds his dogs collar nex to car tracks and a vehicle off in the distance, so he follows them to the city. Exploring the city, he finds a gathering of lots of people nex to a building, so he enters to investigate. Traversing the buildings basement, he finds a passage to the sewers. Exploring the sewers, he finds a door to a laboratory, where a mad scientist has kidnapped not only his dog, but also his wife, his daughter and his cat, and he will have to defeat him to save them all. 

Opcionally, there could be a secret boss in the form of the dog, but mutated.  

When the player dies, he will wake up in his house and everything would have been a premonitory dream warning him of doing things differently.  

## Gameplay: 

The camera would be top-down, showing the scene from a zenithal perspective. 

The player would be able to move in the 4 directions of the 2D space. 

The player would be able to perform a somersault or hop that will dash him forward and make him temporally invulnerable, but he wonâ€™t be able to shoot during that period (?). 

The player would be able to attack with the equipped weapon, which could be melee or ranged. If the player has no weapons equipped, he will attack with punches, the shortest rage melee weapon in the game. 

As he progresses through the dungeon, the weapons and objects that spawn will be more powerfull.  

Enemies drop coins or hearts on kill. The player can use the coins in the dungeon shop to purchase temporary upgrades, or save them for the outer shop to buy permanent, more expensive, upgrades. 

The player can also find game modifiers hidden in chests or in the dungeon shop. Some game modifiers will be positive, buffing the player and reducing the dificulty (more damage dealt, fewer enemies spawning...) and some will be negative, making the experience more challenging (stronger enemies, breaking the equipped weapon...). The effect of the modifier is determined randomly when picked up.  

## Objects: 

Coins and hearts are dropped by enemies.

Game modifiers are rare and can be found in special rooms. 

## Mixed Ideas: 

How do different weapons spawn in the different areas of the dungeon?  

- OPTION 1: same weapons, but with different visual (hammer = hoe = metal pipe, but each one spawns in a different area) and when the player travels to a new zone, his inventory is deleted.  

- OPTION 2: same weapons, but the further in the dungeon, the better (stick < metal pipe). 

- OPTION 3: The weapon pool size changes based on the area the player is in, blocking certain weapon types behind progess (in the fields, there may appear sticks and guns, while in the city sticks cannot be found and instead there are hammers, guns and bazookas). 

Player class system: the same character, but he spawns with a different starting weapon. The class is basically the weapon.   

Then why would it matter? Since he can get rid of it when he finds another weapon, why bother.  

Change weapon pool basedd on the starting class?  

Make weapon spawning less common and more constrained? (DeadCells aproach)
