# KIT-NAP

Kit-Nap is a 2D, top-down-viewed, dungeon crawler, roguelike adventure where the player has to follow the trail of his cat's kidnaping in order to save it. To do that, he will have to traverse 4 different areas, fighting his way through all different sorts of enemies and face a final boss, without dying; otherwise, all of the progress will be lost, and the game will restart.

During their adventure, players will be able to collect objects that will help them progress or make their experience more challenging, such as weapons, coins, game modifiers...

## Story and Theme: 

The protagonist wakes up and realizes his cat is missing, so he goes out to search for it through the Forest that surrounds his cabin. After a while, he finds suspicious car tracks that lead to the city, and decides to follow them there. Exploring the City, he fights his way into a Haunted Hotel and comes across a passage to the Sewers, at the end of which lies a door to a Secret Laboratory where a mad scientist has his kitten kidnapped and he will have to defeat him in order to save the world. 

If the player dies, the protagonist will wake up in his cabin and everything would have been a premonitory dream.
